
-New Device action: Change Logs Retention.

-Add maptype setting?
    maptype=roadmap default, others: terrain, satellite, hybrid
    -Also Setting: default zoom level for map location previews
        -Or maybe it can be just a combo on the Logs page?


-Improve mobile browser detection algorithm implemented in Params.isMobile().

-If After filter is not specified, auto-insert the time specified by Logs Retention.
    -If specified, use the greater one (user-specified and retention-specified), 

-Add a Utils/Calculations page where certain GPS calculations can be done, e.g. distance between 2 geopoints.
    -This will also be of great marketing value as this could be used without registration!
    -This must be done right, because if this is wrong, people would lose trust in other parts of the app too!
    -It should support:
        -Distance between 2 geopoints.

-Rewrite contents of the err_internal.html template.

-Export GPS logs to CSV

-Proper Help detailing the system, setup, requirements etc.

-Implement device operations: Reorder (move up or down in list).
