/*

Package logic contains all page logics.

Logics are responsible to process data sent from clients either as URL or Form parameters,
to fill custom parameters for individual pages.

Logics are also responsible to register the Logic function at the appropriate pages.
This is so that the logic package does not depend on the page package.
